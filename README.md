# E-LifeCommunity-API

#### Introduce
E-LifeCommunity is a project built in July 2022
as a practical project to meet the standard of the practice training.
After training, I transfer it from gitee to github for further development, 
which I hope can be a relatively complete project mainly exert to the management and every day life in a community.

This project is the back end of the project, which is driven by redis and mysql,
and is mainly facing the client end and management end
in the front end.

I hope anybody who tries to use this can give me some feedback so that I can make this project better.

If you want to join this project, leave the message.
